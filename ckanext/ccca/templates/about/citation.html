      <h2>Citation</h2>
      <p>If you use data downloaded from the CCCA Data Server, we strongly encourage
      citing this work as any other scientific research, with respect to resource
      authors and people in charge, even if the data license does not specifically
      demand you to do so.</p>
      <p>Resource packages and data stored within this data server in general are the
      result of hard work and dedication of the authors, collaborators and the CCCA
      Data Centre staff. Some of these resources are individual long-term work of
      researchers, while some belong to important institutions. With citation of used
      data, we are able to keep track of the significance of this research and work,
      to estimate the importance of our role in the process. Furthermore, you
      encourage other community members to share their data without fear of later harm
      on their intellectual property rights.</p>

      <h2>Identification</h2>
      <p>Each resource uploaded to the data server is assigned with a unique Uniform
      Resource Locator, a type of Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), as a reference to
      a web resource location on a computer network along with a mechanism for
      retrieval of this resource. For upcoming development, Persistent Identifiers
      (PID) will be implemented.</p>
      <p>Please use the appropriate URL in all citations.</p>
